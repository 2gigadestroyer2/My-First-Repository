# My-First-Repository
Hi there! To anyone who is reading this, my name is Hao Guo. I am an aspiring developer looking to immerse myself with the technological achievments of today and tommorrow.
I'm hoping to use Github as a learning research and as a way to store versions of my own projects made by myself and others.
